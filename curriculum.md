This content was inspired by and adapted from a 3 month curriculum suggested by [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr6VqTRO1v0). The modifications have been adapted to account for our needs and pace at Kroger. There are 3 core areas it attempts to address

1. Math (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Stats and Probability)
2. Intro to Machine Learning
3. Deep Learning

Feel free to use this as a self paced learning approach. If you dare watch the videos 1.5x or faster as well as take notes. The 2018 Cohort will kick this off in the month of June with group labs to allow for group viewing of lectures and discussions. More content will be added in as this progresses and with some feedback. Add any additional reference materials to the additional resources section.

Week 1 Linear Algebra

The MIT course is an option but pretty long and dense. If you are interested in something more straight to the point check this out instead (Thanks Zachary.anderson)
